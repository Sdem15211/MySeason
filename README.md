# MySeason - AI Personal Color Analysis App

MySeason is a web & mobile application that provides users with an accurate and personalized color and seasonal analysis. It uses a combination of a user-uploaded selfie, a short questionnaire, Computer Vision (Google Cloud Vision API), image processing (`sharp`), and a Large Language Model (Claude 3.5 Sonnet via Vercel AI SDK) to generate results.

Built with Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Drizzle ORM, and Supabase. Users can get an analysis anonymously and optionally create an account using Better Auth to save their results.
