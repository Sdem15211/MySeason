# MVP Refinement Suggestions

This document outlines potential improvements and considerations for the AI Personal Color Analysis application based on the current MVP implementation.

## 3. Session Expiry Check Consistency

**Observation:**
Session expiry (`expiresAt`) is checked correctly in several key routes (`/start`, `/questionnaire`, `/blob/upload`). However, the check is missing in `/api/v1/analysis/validate` and `/api/v1/blob/delete`.

**Risk:**
While the application flow makes it less likely, it's theoretically possible for these endpoints to be called after a session has technically expired, potentially leading to unnecessary processing or unexpected behavior.

**Recommendation:**
Add the `expiresAt` check to the following routes before proceeding with their main logic:

- `POST /api/v1/analysis/validate/route.ts`
- `POST /api/v1/blob/delete/route.ts` (Check if the session exists and _then_ check expiry before attempting deletion).

**Benefit:** Ensures consistent behavior regarding session lifetime across all relevant endpoints, improving overall robustness.

## 4. Global Error Handling (Next.js App Router)

**Observation:**
Root `error.tsx` and `not-found.tsx` files within the `src/app` directory were not confirmed present.

**Recommendation:**
Ensure you have implemented the standard Next.js App Router error handling files:

- **`src/app/error.tsx`:** Catches unhandled errors bubbling up from child segments and provides a fallback UI. Essential for graceful failure handling.
- **`src/app/not-found.tsx`:** Handles requests for routes that don't exist, providing a custom 404 page.

**Benefit:** Improves user experience by providing informative fallback UIs for unexpected errors and 404s, rather than potentially showing cryptic Next.js default error pages.
