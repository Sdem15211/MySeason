# Personal Analysis Summary Card

This document outlines the essential elements to include in the concise, visually appealing, and shareable summary card generated after the color analysis.

## Purpose

The goal of this card is to provide a quick, memorable, and easily shareable overview of the user's core color analysis results. It should be designed attractively, suitable for sharing on social media or saving as a personal reference.

## Content Elements

The card should contain the following key pieces of information extracted from the main analysis output:

1.  **Season:**

    - **Content:** The user's determined color season name (e.g., "True Summer", "Bright Spring").
    - **Presentation:** Display prominently.

2.  **Wow-Color Palette (Mini):**

    - **Content:** A selection of 5-6 key "Wow" colors from their full personal palette.
    - **Presentation:** Display as visual color swatches.

3.  **Best Metal:**

    - **Content:** The primary recommended metal tone (e.g., "Silver", "Gold", "Rose Gold").
    - **Presentation:** Clearly stated, potentially with a small metallic color icon/swatch.

4.  **Colors to Avoid (Mini):**

    - **Content:** 2-3 key colors from their "Minimize/Avoid" list.
    - **Presentation:** Display as small visual color swatches, perhaps slightly deemphasized compared to the Wow colors (e.g., smaller size or with a subtle cross-out icon).

5.  **Overall Vibe:**

    - **Content:** The concise 2-3 sentence descriptive summary from the main analysis output.
    - **Presentation:** Short, engaging text block.

6.  **Basic Makeup Tip (Conditional on Gender = Female):**
    - **Content:** One highly actionable and impactful makeup tip derived from the main recommendations (e.g., "Focus on cool berry lipsticks" or "Warm peach blushes enhance your glow").
    - **Presentation:** A single, concise sentence.

## Optional Elements

- **User's Name/Avatar:** Could be included for personalization if desired and technically feasible.
- **QR Code/Link:** Could link back to their full analysis results page.

## Design Considerations

- Visually clean and modern.
- Reflect the aesthetic of the overall application.
- Ensure readability of text and clarity of color swatches.
- Balanced layout incorporating all elements effectively.
- Appropriate dimensions for social media sharing (e.g., square or vertical format).
