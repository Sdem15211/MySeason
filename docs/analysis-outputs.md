# Color Analysis Outputs

This document describes the desired outputs generated by the color analysis LLM. Each section should provide not only the result but also a **brief, clear explanation of the 'why'** behind the recommendation, tailored to the user's characteristics. **All explanations should be written in clear, simple, and accessible language, avoiding technical jargon where possible. The goal is for the average user to quickly grasp the meaning of their analysis.**

## Core Analysis Results

These are the fundamental classifications based on the input data.

1.  **Your Season:**

    - **Output:** The determined color season (e.g., "True Summer", "Dark Autumn", "Bright Spring").
    - **Explanation:** A concise description of the season's main characteristics (e.g., "True Summer is characterized by cool, muted, and soft coloring. Your features blend gently rather than contrast sharply."). Link it to their key inputs.

2.  **Your Undertone:**

    - **Output:** The confirmed skin undertone (Warm, Cool, Neutral, Olive).
    - **Explanation:** State the undertone clearly and explain how it was determined (e.g., "Based on your vein color, sun reaction, and jewelry preference, you have a Cool undertone. This means colors with a blue base will harmonize best with your skin.").

3.  **Your Contrast Level:**
    - **Output:** The confirmed overall contrast level (High, Medium, Low).
    - **Explanation:** Define what their contrast level means for visual harmony and color pairing (e.g., "You have Medium contrast, meaning there's a moderate difference between your skin, hair, and eye color. You look best in color combinations that reflect this balance, rather than extremes of light and dark.").

## Personalized Recommendations

Actionable advice based on the core analysis.

4.  **Your Personal Color Palette:**

    - **Output:** A curated visual palette featuring:
      - **Wow Colors (5):** The most impactful and flattering shades.
      - **Best Neutrals (3):** Essential base colors for wardrobe building (specific shades like charcoal, ivory, navy, camel).
      - **Accent Colors (maximum 3, focus on 1-2):** Colors for adding pops of interest.
    - **Explanation:** Describe the overall feel of the palette (e.g., "Your palette features cool, deep, and rich colors that complement your Dark Winter characteristics."). Explain _why_ these color families work (e.g., "These blues harmonize with your cool undertone, while the deep intensity matches your contrast level.").

5.  **Colors to Minimize/Avoid:**

    - **Output:** A small visual palette (2-4 colors) that are likely unflattering.
    - **Explanation:** Clearly explain _why_ these specific colors or color families are generally not recommended (e.g., "Bright, warm oranges can clash with your cool undertone, potentially making your skin look sallow." or "Very muted, dusty colors may wash you out due to your high contrast.").

6.  **Best Metal Tones:**

    - **Output:** Recommended metal(s) (e.g., Silver, Gold, Rose Gold, Pewter, Bronze).
    - **Explanation:** Connect the recommendation directly to the undertone (e.g., "With your Warm undertone, Gold and Bronze jewelry will illuminate your complexion beautifully. Silver might appear slightly harsh.").

7.  **Hair Color Guidance:**

    - **Output:** Advice on flattering hair colors, considering their natural color, season, undertone, and contrast.
    - **Explanation:** Reaffirm shades close to their natural color that fit the season. If suggesting changes, be specific and explain the reasoning (e.g., "To enhance your Soft Autumn warmth, consider adding subtle honey or caramel lowlights. Avoid cool ash tones, which could clash with your undertone." or "Maintaining a hair color depth similar to your natural level supports your medium contrast.").

    - **Output:** Actionable tips on using their palette for different looks/scenarios (e.g., professional, elegant, casual).
    - **Explanation:** Provide concrete examples focusing on color combinations and leveraging their contrast level. (e.g., "For a striking professional look, pair your deep charcoal neutral with your ruby red wow color. This high-contrast pairing echoes your natural coloring." or "Create an elegant monochromatic look by layering different shades of your recommended blues.").

10. **Overall Vibe Description:**
    - **Output:** A short, evocative summary (2-3 sentences).
